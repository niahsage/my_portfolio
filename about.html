      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Graphic design has always been a part of my life, thanks to the creative environment I grew up in. Besides just being a creative kid loving any forms of art, my uncle, a web designer, played a big role in sparking my interest early on. Heâ€™d ask for my input on his projects, from choosing colors and layouts to suggesting ways to improve his designs.Those conversations were my first introduction to the creative process, and they made me realize how much I enjoy problem-solving through design. As I got older, my cousin became another source of inspiration. While working at Universal Music Group, he managed tech and visual marketing for major celebrities, giving me a behind-the-scenes look at how impactful good design can be on a large scale. Now, heâ€™s a co-owner of a company focused on 3D digital design and marketing and continues to push boundaries in creative industries. Seeing his journey motivated me to take my passion for design seriously and pursue it as a career.As a transfer from a school with a poorly run art program, I donâ€™t have as many strong class projects as I would like, but I really want to build on what Iâ€™ve learned so far at UCF by immersing myself in a program that challenges me to refine my technical skills and think critically about designâ€™s role in the world. Joining this program would be an important step toward achieving my goal of becoming a graphic designer who creates meaningful, innovative work. Iâ€™m excited to collaborate with others, learn from experienced professionals, and work on combining creativity and technology to make a lasting impact.</p>
