    <h2>ðŸ’– About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-layout">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Design and creativity have always been part of my life. Growing up in a creative environment, I was constantly experimenting with art and visual projects, and my uncle, a web designer, was a big influenceâ€”heâ€™d ask for my input on colors, layouts, and ways to improve his work. Those early experiences sparked my love for problem-solving through design.

Now, as a Digital Media student at the University of Central Florida (B.A., Web & Interactive Media track, planned Marketing minor, GPA: 3.4, expected 2027), I focus on web development, UX/UI design, and graphic design. Iâ€™ve built responsive websites, interactive web projects, and branding materials using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, and Adobe Creative Suite. I also enjoy exploring marketing and analytics tools like Google Analytics to understand how design impacts real-world engagement.

Iâ€™m excited to keep learning, collaborate with other creatives, and combine my technical skills with my love for design to make work thatâ€™s not just beautiful, but meaningful.</p>
